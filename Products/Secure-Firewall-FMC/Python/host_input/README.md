# Cisco Secure Firewall Hst Input Client

## Purpose:

The purpose of this script is to parse command-line arguments and initialize an instance of SFHostInputAgent with the parsed options, then execute its processing logic.
Dependencies:

    getopt: This module is used to parse command-line arguments and options.
    sys: This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
    SFHostInputAgent class from sf_agent: This class encapsulates the functionality of the host input agent.

## Functions and Classes:

main():

    This function serves as the entry point for the script.
    It first tries to parse the command-line arguments using getopt.getopt().
    The parsed options are stored in the opts variable, and any errors encountered during parsing are caught and printed.
    The parsed options are then processed and converted into a dictionary named parsed_opts.
    An instance of SFHostInputAgent is created, and its processCommandLine() method is called with the parsed options.
    The process() method of the SFHostInputAgent instance is then called to execute the main logic of the host input agent.
    Any exceptions raised during the execution of the agent are caught, printed, and the script exits with an error code of 2.

name == "main":

    This condition ensures that the main() function is only executed if the script is run directly and not imported as a module.

## Usage:

To run the script, execute it from the command line with appropriate options and arguments. The options and their meanings are as follows:

    -p, --port: Specify the port number.
    -k, --pkcs12: Specify the PKCS12 file.
    -w, --password: Specify the password.
    -i, --plugininfo: Specify the plugin information.
    -s, --server: Specify the server address.
    -r, --runondc: Specify whether to run on DC.
    -c, --csvfile: Specify the CSV file.
    -y, --syslog: Enable syslog logging.
    -l, --logfile: Specify the logfile path.
    -e, --stderr: Log to stderr.
    -m, --level: Specify the log level.
    -g, --ipv6: Enable IPv6.

```python
python script.py --port 8080 --server example.com --syslog --logfile /var/log/script.log
```

### Imports:

    getopt: Module for parsing command-line arguments.
    os: Module providing a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality.
    re: Module providing regular expression matching operations.
    signal: Module providing mechanisms to manage asynchronous events.
    socket: Module providing access to the BSD socket interface.
    ssl: Module providing access to SSL cryptographic services.
    struct: Module providing functions to convert between Python values and C structs.
    sys: Module providing access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
    syslog: Module providing access to the Unix syslog library routines.
    time: Module providing various time-related functions.

### Constants:

    DEFAULT_CRT_FILE: Default path to the server certificate file.
    DEFAULT_KEY_FILE: Default path to the server key file.
    (ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG): Tuple containing numeric values for different logging levels.

### Classes:

    SFHIClient:
        Class representing a client for a specific service.
        Contains methods for creating a new client, sending data to the server, receiving data from the server, and performing memory reporting.

    SFHILog:
        Class representing a logging utility.
        Contains methods for logging messages to syslog, stderr, and a logfile.

    SFHostInputAgent:
        Class representing a host input agent.
        Contains methods for handling command-line options, processing options, and executing agent logic.

## Functions:

    main():
        The entry point of the script.
        Parses command-line arguments using getopt, initializes an instance of SFHostInputAgent, and executes its processing logic.

### Usage:

To use this module, import it into another Python script and call its functions or instantiate its classes as needed.

```python
import host_input

# Example usage:
host_input.main()  # Run the main function to execute the script's logic
```

### Return Codes:

    0: Script executed successfully.
    2: Error detected during the execution of the host input agent.
